This project is a Java-based application designed to process JSON test cases. It reads input data from JSON files, performs specific operations based on the data, and outputs a result. The application uses the JSON-simple library for parsing and manipulating JSON objects. The program handles test cases involving secret values and calculates results by performing basic mathematical operations. It integrates file reading, JSON parsing, and logic processing to extract the required information and print the corresponding secret values. The solution demonstrates how to manage external libraries, handle file I/O operations, and work with structured data in a Java application.
